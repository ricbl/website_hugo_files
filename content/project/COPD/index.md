<div style="text-align: justify "> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After collecting a dataset of chest x-rays and pulmonary function tests of the same patient within six months of the x-ray, we performed several investigations in terms of automatic medical image assessment and the interpretability of associated models. These investigations include: 
<ul>
     <li> modeling the modifications caused by disease severity in the chest x-rays (<a href="/publication/lanfredi-2019-adversarial/">check here</a>),</li>
     <li> using deformation fields to model disease effect to find dataset biases (<a href="/publication/lanfredi-2020-flow/">check here</a>),</li>
     <li> proposing a mathematical formulation to associate interpretability alignment with adversarial robustness, and </li>
     <li> showing that the chest x-rays provide more information about COPD diagnosis than radiologist reports (<a href="/publication/schroeder-2021-copd/">check here</a>).</li>
 </ul>
