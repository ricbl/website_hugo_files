<div style="text-align: justify "> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is NIH-funded, started in 2020, and aims to collect eye-tracking data as a non-intrusive way of providing localization information on labels associated with each chest x-ray. The data collection will include timestamped transcriptions of the dictations o radiological reports, making the association between region looked and word said at a given moment possible. The project's steps include: 
<ul>
    <li>providing all collected data as an open dataset,</li>
	<li>evaluating interpretability methods for deep learning methods when compared to the attention from radiologists, and</li>
    <li>using collected data as supervision for novel deep learning models.</li>
</ul>
