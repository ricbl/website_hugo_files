<div style="text-align: justify "> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is NIH-funded, starting in 2020, and aims to collect eye-tracking data as a non-intrusive way of providing localization information on labels associated with each x-ray. The data collection will include the audio recording of reports, making the association between region looked and word said at a given moment possible. The project's steps include: 
<ul>
    <li>analyzing the alignment between dictation / eye fixations / pupil dilation / bounding box annotations,</li>
    <li>providing all collected data as an open dataset, and</li>
    <li>using collected data as supervision for novel deep learning models.</li>
</ul>
